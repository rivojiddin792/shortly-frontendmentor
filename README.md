Shortly â€“ URL Shortening Landing Page ðŸš€

A responsive landing page that integrates with a URL shortening API, built as part of a Frontend Mentor challenge. Enables users to shorten any valid URL, view a history of shortened links persistently, and copy results with one clickâ€”all styled with modern UI/UX best practices.

Demo

Live site: https://shortly-challange.netlify.app

Features

Responsive design: Seamlessly adapts to mobile, tablet, and desktop layouts.

URL shortening: Users input a URL and receive a shortened version via a public API.

History tracking: Shortened links are saved in local storage and persist on page reloads.

Copy to clipboard: Click a button to copy the short link; button label toggles to "Copied!" for user feedback.

Form validation: Empty or invalid inputs trigger error messages beneath the input field.

Built With

HTML5 & CSS3 (with modern layout techniques like flexbox and grid)

JavaScript (ES6+)

Public URL Shortening API (e.g., CleanURI, Bitly, or similar)

Getting Started

What I Learned

Integrating with a third-party API using fetch() and handling JSON responses.

Persisting data with localStorage for client-side history.

Managing UI state (loading, error, copied feedback) with vanilla JS.

Rendering dynamic content with templates in the DOM.

Accessibility and responsive layout best practices.

Roadmap / Future Enhancements

âœ… Copy-to-clipboard feedback ("Copied!" button state)

âœ… Persistent history with removal option for each entry

ðŸ”² URL validation with regex or external library

ðŸ”² Integrate with custom domains or third-party APIs (Bitly, Rebrandly)

ðŸ”² UI improvements: better error handling, animated transitions

ðŸ”² End-to-end testing (e.g., with Cypress)
